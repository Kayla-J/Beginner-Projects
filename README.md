##Task 
The  local  cinema  must  send  80%  of  its  ticket  receipts  to  the  movie  distributor.  The  manager  has 
asked you to write a small program that will print an invoice for weekly ticket income and profits 
for a given movie.
Adult  tickets  sell  for  $7.50  and  children  tickets  are  $4.75.  The  program  will  ask  the  user  for  the 
name of the movie, the number of adults tickets sold, and the number of children tickets sold. Use 
a C-String to store the movie name.
The program will compute the gross box office revenue, the distributor amount, and the net profit. 
It will then echo back the movie name along with the three computed values. It should display the 
amounts  using  a  dollar  sign  and  two  decimal  places  (use  setprecision()  ).  Use  setw()  to  get  the 
decimal places to align
