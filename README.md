# Beginner Stage
I started my first project as a freshman in Computer Science.
My first project involved creating a program that will create an invoice for a local cinema manager.

This project was programmed in C++ language and consisted of using user input and output. This program also made use of formatting allignment functions within the iomanip library such as setw and setprecision.

The description of the project is explained in the 
[Project1 document](https://github.com/Kayla-J/Beginner-Projects/files/8696195/Project1.docx).
